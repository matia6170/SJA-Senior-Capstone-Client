          Until now, during the COVID pandemic, I saw many people who didn’t
          follow quarantine guidelines. I want to create a product that gives
          people awareness of how following the rules could help reduce the
          spread of COVID. It will be a videogame/simulation, where there is an
          environment with a population in which COVID starts to spread. Then
          the player is supposed to apply different types of quarantine rules to
          reduce the number of infections. This will raise awareness of how
          following COVID instructions will help reduce the spread of the virus.
          If time allows, I would like to add a website alongside the game.

          When COVID first hit, I was living in Israel. During the early stages
          of COVID, Israel was one of the top 10 countries in the world with the
          most infected people. Therefore, I saw intense quarantine rules being
          employed on the people such as not being able to leave from 100m
          radius limit to 500m limit from one’s house. However, I saw many
          Israelis not following these rules and even having parties in some
          cases. As a result, infected people increased and increased. I’ve
          always wondered why people did not follow these rules and wondered if
          it was because the effects weren’t real to them. So I wanted to create
          something that would raise awareness about these rules. Additionally,
          with my interest in programming since middle school, I thought it
          would be interesting to create a simulation game that could give
          people awareness about the quarantine rules.

          For this project, I will mainly focus on GEC, but I believe that this
          could be applied to the whole world. Since my final project will be a
          videogame, it would be available to download everywhere in the world.
          It would give awareness about the quarantine rules all around the
          world. Hopefully, along with the website with COVID information, this
          project will make more people aware of the importance of quarantine
          rules and make them follow the rules better.

          My expected result is a fully finished game described in the first
          paragraph and the players gaining awareness of the importance of
          quarantine rules. I will first create a survey before playing video
          games. I will first survey their perceived importance of quarantine
          rules and how well they follow them. After the game has been finished,
          I will create a second survey asking if by playing this game if they
          gained awareness of quarantine rules and how likely they will follow
          the rules. Then I will do a two-sample Z test of proportions to see if
          there was a significant increase in the proportion of people who had
          the awareness of how important the quarantine rules are and how
          important it is to follow them.

          I will learn how to create an advanced simulation and how to simulate
          a virus spreading and how it is affected by different factors like
          quarantine rules. Additionally, I will also learn the importance of
          quarantine rules myself. Although I had created many video games in
          the past, I haven’t created simulation games before. In addition, I
          will be able to learn how to create a website. I hope to improve my
          skills in this area as well.
